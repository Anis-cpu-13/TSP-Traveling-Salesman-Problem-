# TSP-Traveling-Salesman-Problem-
 The TSP is a problem of optimization and is part of the NP-complete problems. In this project, the goal was to propose an optimal solution using the data structures List and Vector. The algorithm 2-opt was used for the resolution, and the results showed that the List structure was more optimal in terms of execution time and memory.
